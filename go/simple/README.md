# Welcome, Team Ensign

We're happy you're here!

This mini-project will help to test that your API keys are working as expected.
*Note: this assumes that you've already registered for API keys -- if you still need to do that, first go to [rotational.app](https://rotational.app/), create an account, and then generate and download your keys.*

Now clone this project:

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:rotationalio/ensign-examples.git
$ cd ensign-examples/go/simple
```

Next, go to your bash profile and create two new environment variables:

```
export ENSIGN_CLIENT_ID="your client id here"
export ENSIGN_CLIENT_SECRET="your client secret here"
```

Now `source` your profile and run `main.go`:

```bash
$ go run main.go
```
